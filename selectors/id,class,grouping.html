            <p id="para1">Biryani is the primary dish in a meal, while the pulao is usually a secondary accompaniment to a larger meal.
                In biryani, meat (and vegetables, if present) and rice are cooked separately before being layered and cooked together for the gravy to absorb into the rice. Pulao is a single-pot dish: meat (or vegetables) and rice are cooked separately and they are not mixed. However, some other writers have reported pulao recipes in which the rice and meat are cooked together and then simmered for dum cooking until the liquid is absorbed.[23][26]
                Biryanis have more complex and stronger spices compared to pulao.
                The British-era author Abdul Halim Sharar mentions that biryani has a stronger taste of curried rice due to a greater amount of spices</p>

            <p id="para2">The different ingredients—meat, rice, potatoes—have different cooking times: tender cuts of meat/chicken can be fully cooked well before the rice is done. To prevent this, many kacchi recipes use parboiled (semi-cooked) rice rather than raw rice.
                If direct heat is used, there is a risk that the food layer in contact with the vessel bottom may get burned while the interior's contents are still raw. This risk is minimized by sustained baking with moderate heat or very slow cooking on low direct heat. This approach, however, increases cooking time considerably.
                One method is cooking the dish "blind", with the cooking vessel sealed, so one cannot monitor the cooking progress—it takes the understanding of the raw foods used, the heat required to cook those raw foods, and how the climate can affect the cooking process. Hence making kacchi biryani requires a seasoned hand.</p>
